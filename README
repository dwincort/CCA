A Library and Preprocessor for Causal Commutative Arrows (CCA)
==============================================================

This library implements the CCA normalization described in the paper [1].
It uses Template Haskell as a staged compilation for arrow programs written
in arrow syntax. A modified arrow preprocesor based on Paterson's arrowp
program, now called ccap, is provided to help preparing proper input to 
Template Haskell. 

Note that this is a preliminary release, and still very experimental. Please
send your feedbacks directly to Paul H. Liu <paul@thev.net>, as well as
Eric Cheng <eric.cheng@yale.edu>. All suggestions are welcome.

ChangeLog:

    Mon Apr 12 EDT 2010: 

        Normalize to loopD instead of loopB, add more test cases, add support
        for GHC 6.12.1, and bump version to 0.1.3.

    Sun Sep 13 EDT 2009: Some cleanup using HLint, bump version to 0.1.2.
